"""Velma - a Cluedo AI package.

This package provides:
   1. A specialist artificial intelligence designed to play the game of 
      "Cluedo" (Or "Clue", for Americans).
   2. A very basic command-line interface by which this virtual detective
      may be either run as an assistant or played as an adversary without
      any further development work.
   3. Tips on integrating the AI into third party game apps.
